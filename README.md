# RaspberryMinecraftServer
Raspberry setup for running a Minecraft server with install and maintenance menu

The idea is to create a program that can read/write a config file which contains te variables to setup an personal Minecraft server, running from a Raspberry Pi (maybe other devices, however developed for Raspberry Pi)

Menu structure based on code from:
https://gist.github.com/guestl/858e882a37442316fd7cdb0ca1b8e3a5#file-menu-py

Also use this source to setup a config file and extract code examples to read/write data from it:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html
